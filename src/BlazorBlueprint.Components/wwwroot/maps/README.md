# World map data

`world.json` is derived from Natural Earth v5.1.2, Admin 0 Countries at 1:50m scale.

- Source: https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/v5.1.2/geojson/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.geojson
- License: public domain, https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/
- Rebuild: download the source and run `python3 scripts/build-world-map.py <source.geojson>` from the repository root.

The build retains polygon geometry, rounds coordinates to four decimal places,
keeps English names and country-code aliases, and excludes Antarctica. There are
241 countries and regions. Small islands absent from the source are also absent
here. This is an overview visualization, not a detailed boundary reference.
France and Norway use Natural Earth's ISO fallback codes; Kosovo accepts XK/KOS.
Regions without an ISO code are matched by their English names.
